###1 - Panel	
The panel is where your menu, options, whatever… will live. You must include a .panel class in your stylesheet for it to properly function. Not much more to say about that.



###2- Mask
The mask throws a DIV overlay on the body to dim the content from the user to bring focus to the menu. This must include the .mask class in the stylesheet to work correctly. Feel free to modify the style, but always leave the z-index lower then the .panel class!

###3- Mask Default CSS Styles
This is the default CSS style for the mask that covers the entire window. Reminder: the z-index can be whatever you want as long as it’s less then the z-index of the panel.
```
#!css

.mask{
	background: rgba(0,0,0,0.42);  //You can change this to your liking
	height: 100%;
	width: 100%;   // these just cover the entire screen, so leave it, dingus
	z-index: 9998;
	position: fixed;
	top:0;  // Leave this at 0 to avoid it from pushing with the content.	
	}
```
###4- Panel Default CSS Styles
This is the default and minimum for the .panel styles. Again, the panel is where you off canvas content will live. 
```
#!css

.panel{
	  position: absolute;
	  width: 100%; 
	  top: 0;         // keeps the panel up at the top
          display: none;
	  -ms-overflow-style:none;  //this disables scrollbars in Internet Explorer
	  z-index: 9999;  // this is important. it can be whatever you want as long as its over you content and above the mask
	  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
	  }

```
###5- Closing the NAV with Nav Items

You can choose to close the nav when clicking on the navigation items in the nav panel. Just place ‘nav-item’ on the LI or A element. For example:

```
#!HTML

<nav>
    <ul>
        <li class=“nav-item”>
	    <a href=“#”>Home</a>
	</li>
	<li class=“nav-item”>
	    <a href=“#”>Portfolio</a>
	</li>
	<li class=“nav-item”>
	    <a href=“#”>About Us</a>
	</li>
	<li class=“nav-item”>
	     <a href=“#”>Contact</a>
	</li>
    </ul>
</nav>

```
###6- Future Updates & Ramblings

We could try to blur the background? 


###7- Bugs and Tips
* Don't want the nav to push down the body content? That's fine... just move the <div> containing 'panel' wherever you want the drop down to originate from and play with the positioning of the item in the JS file.
