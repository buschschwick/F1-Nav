VERSION 1.3+ Now lives on GitHub, no longer bitbucket. 

VERSION 1.3 12/17/2014
———————————————————————————
Version 1.3 adds the ability to close the nav when clicking on the navigation link. The class is applied to the LI with a class of ‘nav-item’. 

VERSION 1.2 12/16/2014
———————————————————————————
Version 1.2 adds some new functionality and eye candy. We ditched font awesome for the ‘hamburger’ icon and use <span></span> to allow for an animation/transform into an X for closing the nav. This includes some big changes to the jQuery as well as a handful of CSS properties.

The jQuery now counts the clicks from the user on both the mask and the icon, to apply or remove the mask. 


VERSION 1.1 10/22/2014
———————————————————————————
Version 1.1 improves upon the initial 1.0 where all the nav did was push down the body, creates a mask that overlays the body to darken the content and detect clicks to close the nav.  (those were the days).
